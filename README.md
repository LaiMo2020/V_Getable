# Milestone Project 4: V-Getable

![Presentaion photo ](media/README-images/responsice.png)

The purpose of the project “V-getable” is to build a full-stack site based around business logic used to control a centrally-owned dataset.

The site includes an online store connecting a group of farms and gardeners selling local products, such as vegetables, fruit, eggs, milk and bread with clients interested in supporting local business. Clients can browse through products, make a selection, shop and pay their order. As a client with a profile, the page offers an option to get free delivery and discounts. Admin-options allow the shop-owner to add and edit products and keep track on the clients orders as well as interact with and inform clients on a blog.

## UX

The online-shop “V-getable” offers a great option for everyone that cares about healthy, ecological and locally produced products in his nutrition.

A variety of products, nicely presented, attracts visitors on the page to make their choice on how much and what they like and save products in their shopping basket. Sending the order and paying directly by credit card makes it easy to receive fresh products all the way to home while preventing singular car-trips to the countryside.

The shop owner profits from various and easy-to-handle options when it comes to setting up new products, prices and keep track on incoming orders and requests. The blog, included, in the page, allows the company to post news and background information about their way of farming and production of their products. This raises trust for clients interested where their food comes from and how it is produced. Clients even have the option to comment and interact thereby with the farmers.

###  Wireframe 
For the creation of my wireframes I used the Balsamiqu program (see “technologies used"). Throughout the development of the webpage the wireframes were very helpful for me to reach the final design.

I have created mobile, tablet, desktop and tablet wireframes.
